This protocol is employed for device registration purposes, enabling devices to receive push notifications from the issuer server. The issuer server is designed to accept this message and store device-related information. It's important to note that the information captured does not include any data that can be linked to the user's device, and thus cannot be exploited for user deanonymization purposes.
