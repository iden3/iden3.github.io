This protocol bears a strong resemblance to the authorization protocol, with the primary distinction being its exclusive use for transmitting proofs from Alice to Bob. It is NOT recommended to employ this protocol for the authorization flow. In certain scenarios, participants may need to interact with a smart contract to verify zkproof on-chain and facilitate other communications. This protocol encompasses all the necessary information for establishing communication with smart contracts and Exchanging of proofs.
